## B.3 - Trust & Assurance Calculus (F–G–R with Congruence)

> **Plain‑English headline.**
> B.3 defines how **assurance** (trust) is **computed and propagated** for both physical systems and knowledge artifacts, using a small **typed assurance tuple** (**F–G–R**: **F/R** characteristics plus **G** as scope object) and **conservative aggregation rules** that respect the Γ‑invariants and A.15 **Strict Distinction**. It treats the **Working‑Model layer** as the **publication surface** for claims, with assurance **attached downward** (Mapping - Logical - Constructive - Empirical) per E.14.

### B.3:1 - Problem frame

Every non‑trivial result in FPF—*a composed system is safe*, *a model is credible*, *a conclusion holds*—is a **claim** that rests on **composed evidence**.

* For **U.System** holons (Γ\_sys), assurance is about *capabilities and constraints* under stated conditions.
* For **U.Episteme** holons (Γ\_epist), assurance is about the *quality of support* for a statement or model.

To make such claims comparable and auditable across domains, B.3 introduces a **Trust & Assurance Calculus** that:

* uses a **small typed assurance tuple** (**F–G–R**: **F/R** characteristics plus **G** as scope object) governed by conservative propagation rules (this is **not** a state space),
* accounts for **integration quality** via **Congruence Level (CL)** along the edges of a `DependencyGraph` (B.1.1, A.14),
* and composes these values with **Γ‑flavours** while respecting the **Invariant Quintet** (IDEM, COMM/LOC or their replacements, WLNK, MONO).

B.3 is **conceptual and normative**: it defines *which assurance components must be published and how they propagate*. How you improve those components (e.g., formalize, replicate, reconcile, or lawfully widen/narrow scope) is the job of KD‑CAL actions (the knowledge‑dynamics patterns; references are descriptive, not required to read here).

**Mechanism linkage.** For law‑governed operation families (e.g., **USM/UNM**) authored as **mechanisms**, use A.6.1 — U.Mechanism to publish **OperationAlgebra/LawSet/AdmissibilityConditions** and the **Transport** clause (Bridge‑only, CL/CL^k/CL^plane). All such penalties **reduce `R/R_eff` only**; **F/G** remain invariant.

**Working‑Model handshake (alignment with E.14 - B.3.5 - C.13).**  
Assurance consumes two inputs declared at the **Working‑Model** surface (CT2R‑LOG, B.3.5): the **justification stance** `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}` and, where present, the **grounding link** `tv:groundedBy`. Structural claims that aspire to the strongest guarantees rely on **Constructive** grounding as a **Γₘ** (Compose‑CAL) narrative referenced via `tv:groundedBy`. No assurance artefact **defines** Working‑Model wording or layout (downward‑only dependence, E.14).

### B.3:2 - Problem

Without a disciplined calculus, four chronic failures appear:

1. **Trust inflation:** Averaging or summing heterogeneous “quality” tags yields aggregates that look better than their weakest parts, violating WLNK.
2. **Scale confusion:** Mixing ordinal and ratio scales (e.g., averaging “formality levels” with numeric reliabilities) produces meaningless numbers.
3. **Congruence blindness:** Integration quality (how well pieces fit) is invisible; brilliantly strong parts connected by weak mappings produce overconfident wholes.
4. **Scope drift:** Design‑time formalism and run‑time evidence are composed into a single score; dashboards then claim “assurance” for a blueprint using live data, or vice versa.


### B.3:3 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservatism vs. Synthesis**           | Avoid overclaiming (WLNK) ↔ allow real gains from better integration (raise CL) or true emergence (B.2).                            |
| **Universality vs. Domain nuance**       | One calculus for systems and epistemes ↔ physics and epistemology use different primitives; keep them comparable but not identical. |
| **Simplicity vs. Fidelity**              | Keep the assurance tuple small and typed (A.11) ↔ capture enough structure to be informative and improvable by KD‑CAL actions.           |
| **Static clarity vs. Dynamic evolution** | A score must be reproducible today ↔ tomorrow it should legitimately rise after formalization, replication, or reconciliation.      |


### B.3:4 - Solution — **Part 1: The assurance tuple and the universal aggregation skeleton**

B.3 defines **what** the assurance components are, **how** they live on nodes and edges of the dependency graph, and the **shape** of the aggregation that any Γ‑flavour must honor when producing an *assurance result*.

#### B.3:4.1 - The F–G–R assurance components (typed; `F/R` CHR, `G` USM)

We standardize **two node characteristics**, **one node scope object**, and **one edge characteristic**:

1. **Formality (F)** — *how constrained the reasoning is by explicit, proof‑grade structure.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** (levels do not admit arithmetic).
   * **Canonical levels (example):**
        `F0 Informal prose` - `F1 Structured narrative` - `F2 Formalizable schema` - `F3 Proof‑grade formalism`.
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better (never lowers assurance when all else fixed).

2. **ClaimScope (G)** — *the declared set of `U.ContextSlice` where the result applies.*

   * **Type:** **set‑valued USM scope object** (A.2.6), **not** a CHR characteristic.
   * **Well‑typed operations:** **membership** and **set algebra** (`∈`, `⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`, `SpanUnion`, plus declared Bridge translation / widen / narrow / refit).
   * **Scalar proxy (report‑only):** if a profile needs a number for reporting, it MAY publish an explicitly declared **`CoverageMetric(G)`**; such a proxy **MUST NOT** replace `G` in norms, gates, bridge semantics, or CL routing.
3. **Reliability (R)** — *how likely the claim/behavior holds under stated conditions.*

   * **Scale kind:** **ratio** in `[0,1]` (or a conservative ordinal proxy when numeric modeling is unavailable).
   * **Monotone direction:** higher is better.

2. **Congruence Level (CL)** — *edge property: how well two parts fit* (semantic alignment, calibration, interface Standard).

   * **Scale kind:** **ordinal** with a **monotone penalty function** `Φ(CL)` where `Φ` decreases as CL increases.
   * **Canonical levels (example):**
     `CL0 weak guess` - `CL1 plausible mapping` - `CL2 validated mapping` - `CL3 verified equivalence`.
   * **Interpretation:** low CL reduces the credibility of the *integration itself* (not the parts), and therefore **penalizes** the aggregate **R**.

> **Strict Distinction (A.15).**
>
> * Assurance components live at **value/scope level**: **F/R** as characteristics, **G** as a scope object, while Γ‑flavours fold **structure/order/time**.
> * Do not smuggle assurance components into structural edges; keep **F/R/CL** explicit as CHR metadata and **G** explicit as a USM scope object.

> **Assurance shoulders (Working‑Model split).**  
> **Mapping** raises **TA** (typing, fit/CL). **Logical** and **Constructive** contribute to **VA** (intended relation semantics; Γₘ extensional identity for structure). **Empirical Validation** contributes to **LA** (evidence in a bounded context). These supports attach **downward** from the Working‑Model surface (E.14).

#### B.3:4.2 - Assurance as a typed claim

B.3 speaks about **assurance of a specific typed claim** `C` over a holon `H` under context `K` and scope `S ∈ {design, run}`:

```
Assurance(H, C | K, S) = ⟨F_eff, G_eff, R_eff, Notes⟩
```

* `C` examples: *meets load L*, *argument Q holds*, *model M predicts within δ*.
* `K` binds assumptions (environment, usage, priors).
* `Notes` include the **SCR** (all sources, B.1.3), **OrderSpec/TimeWindow** where applicable (B.1.4), cutsets, and evidence citations (A.10).

This tuple gives readers an at‑a‑glance view (didactic primacy) while preserving the pieces needed for audit and improvement.

**Validation modes (declaration, normative).** 
Each published Working‑Model assertion **SHALL** declare **`validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`** (E.14).  
— *postulate* → pragmatic working claim; **Empirical Validation** is **required** for audit.  
— *inferential* → reasoned consequence; **Logical** assurance carries the burden.  
— *axiomatic* → constructive identity; **structural** edges MUST provide a Γₘ narrative and a **`tv:groundedBy`** pointer (C.13, B.3.5).

**Design vs run (no chimeras).** Assurance tuples for **design‑time** and **run‑time** SHALL be reported **separately** and **not composed into a single score**; see the *Scope drift* hazard in §2 and the obligations in B.3.3.

#### B.3:4.3 - Where the numbers live (and do not)

* **On nodes:** each input holon contributes its local `F, G, R` according to its nature (system vs. episteme).
* **On edges:** each integration step has a `CL` (congruence of the connection).
* **Not inside Γ:** Γ consumes `D` and returns a composed holon; B.3 governs how `F, G, R, CL` **propagate** to the **Assurance** tuple for that composed holon. This keeps Γ algebra and assurance calculus **separable** and reviewable.
* **Not a state space:** `⟨F,G,R⟩` is an **assurance tuple**, not a `U.CharacteristicSpace`; do **not** draw “trajectories” in `⟨F,G,R⟩`. For episteme evolution, use **ESG** states and the **assurance‑trace** hooks (see below).

#### B.3:4.4 - Universal aggregation skeleton (domain‑neutral)

Any Γ‑flavour that claims an **Assurance** result **must** adopt the following **conservative skeleton**:

1. **Formality:**

   ```
   F_eff = min_i F_i
   ```

   *Rationale:* the least formal piece caps the formality of the whole (WLNK on F).
   *Monotone:* raising any `F_i` cannot reduce `F_eff`.

2. **ClaimScope:**

   ```
   G_eff = SpanUnion({G_i}) constrained by support
   ```

   * “SpanUnion” is a **set/coverage union** in the domain’s space.
   * **Constraint:** any region in the union **unsupported** by reliable parts is **dropped** (WLNK).
   * *Monotone:* adding supported span cannot reduce `G_eff`.

3. **Reliability (penalized by integration):**

   ```
   R_raw = min_i R_i                       // Weakest-link cap
   R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min))       // Congruence penalty
   ```

   * `CL_min` is the **lowest** congruence level on any edge in the proof spine / critical integration region for the claim `C`.
   * `Φ` is **monotone decreasing** and **bounded** (never makes negative values).
   * *Monotone:* increasing any `R_i` or any `CL` cannot lower `R_eff`.

4. **SCR and Notes:**
   * The aggregate SHALL produce a SCR listing all contributing nodes and edges, with their F, G, R, CL, scopes, and evidence links (A.10).  
   * The SCR SHALL additionally surface the **describedEntity** (`describe(Object→GroundingHolon)`) and the **ReferencePlane** for the claim, and present a **separable TA/VA/LA table** of evidence contributions with **valid_until/decay** marks and the **Epistemic‑Debt** per § B.3.4.  
   * If order/time mattered for the claim, attach the OrderSpec or TimeWindow identifiers (B.1.4).

This skeleton is **mandatory**. Domain‑specific patterns may add **refinements** (e.g., separate epistemic “replicability” vs. “calibration”) as long as they **do not violate** WLNK or MONO and preserve scale kinds.


#### B.3:4.5 - System vs. Episteme — same shape, different readings

* **For systems (Γ\_sys):**

  * `F` reads as **engineering discipline** (from ad‑hoc procedure to verified specification).
  * `G` reads as **operational envelope coverage**.
  * `R` reads as **assured reliability** under `K` (requirements, environment, test campaigns).
  * `CL` often arises at **interfaces** (Boundary‑Inheritance Standard; B.1.2): poorly controlled interfaces reduce `R_eff`.

* **For epistemes (Γ\_epist):**

  * `F` reads as **logical/semantic formality** (from prose to proof).
  * `G` reads as **domain span** (concepts, populations, conditions).
  * `R` reads as **evidential support** (replication quality, measurement integrity).
  * `CL` measures **semantic alignment** of merged constructs (terminology mapping, ontology bridges, calibration).

> **Agentness is separate (A.13).**
> Agency metrics (Agency‑CHR) **do not enter the skeleton by default**. They may act as a **contextual overlay** (e.g., to argue why a supervisory policy can maintain `R` across disturbances), but **never** to bypass **WLNK** or the **CL penalty**. Grade shifts should be modeled as **MHT** events when they create new capabilities.


#### B.3:4.6 - Scale discipline (CHR guard‑rails)

To prevent silent misuse:

* **Ordinal scales (F, CL):** never average or subtract; only `min`/`max`, thresholds, and monotone comparisons are allowed.
* **Coverage scales (G):** use union/intersection in a declared domain space; do not “average” sets. If a numeric proxy is used (e.g., coverage ratio), it **must** be derived from a set operation, not vice versa.
* **Ratio scales (R):** may be combined with `min`, `max`, or **explicitly justified** conservative functions; do not add R’s from different contexts without normalization of `K` (assumptions).


#### B.3:4.7 - What improves the tuple (action patterns, high‑level)

B.3 remains neutral about *how* improvement happens, but for didactic clarity:

* **Raise F:** formalize narratives (specifications, machine‑checked models).
* **Raise G:** enlarge supported span (new test regimes, new populations) with adequate evidence.
* **Raise R:** replicate, calibrate, tighten measurement error, reduce bias.
* **Raise CL:** reconcile vocabularies, align units, formalize mappings, verify interface Standards.

Each of these corresponds to recognizable **Transformer roles** and KD‑CAL moves (design‑time); their **run‑time** counterparts are covered by Γ\_time (phase evidence) and Γ\_work (cost of obtaining assurance).

### B.3:4.8 - Prohibition (normative) — F–G–R is not a CharacteristicSpace
Do not treat `⟨F,G,R⟩` as a `U.CharacteristicSpace` and do not define geometric **trajectories** over it. Use **ESG** for episteme state and the **assurance‑trace** hooks for trends in assurance tuples.

### B.3:5 Proof obligations (attach these when producing an Assurance tuple)

These obligations refine the generic Proof Kit from **B.1.1 §6** for **assurance** outputs. Each Γ‑flavour that emits an *Assurance(H, C | K, S)* tuple MUST attach the applicable obligations below.

#### B.3:5.1 - Common obligations (all Γ‑flavours)

* **ASS‑CLM (Typed claim & context).**
  State the **claim** `C` (what is being assured), the **context** `K` (assumptions, environment), and the **scope** `S ∈ {design, run}`.

* **ASS‑SCA (Scale discipline).**
  Declare the **scale kind** used for each characteristic (F ordinal, G coverage, R ratio) and confirm that all operations are **admissible** for that kind (no averaging of ordinals; G via set/coverage ops).

* **ASS‑WLNK (Weakest‑link evidence).**
  Identify the **cutset** (node or edge set) that caps F/G/R for the claim (the proof spine for epistemes, the structural or assurance bottleneck for systems).

* **ASS‑CL (Congruence path).**
  Identify the **relevant integration path(s)** and record `CL_min` used in the penalty `Φ(CL_min)`.

* **ASS‑MAN (SCR).**
  Produce a **SCR** listing all contributing nodes and edges with `(F, G, R)` and `CL` values, their **DesignRunTag**, and Evidence Graph Ref (A.10). If order or time were material, include the **OrderSpec** or **TimeWindow** identifiers from **B.1.4**.

* **ASS‑MONO (Declared monotone characteristics).**
  List the characteristics along which local improvement cannot reduce the aggregate (this supports future evolution, B.4).

#### B.3:5.2 - Γ\_sys (systems) — additional obligations

* **CORE‑BIC (Interface congruence).**
  Reference the **Boundary‑Inheritance Standard** (BIC) from **B.1.2** and record any interface mismatches; these contribute to `CL_min`.

* **CORE‑ENV (Operating envelope).**
  Specify the domain used for **G** (e.g., load–temperature region) and how coverage is computed (set union constrained by support).

#### B.3:5.3 - Γ\_epist (epistemes) — additional obligations

* **EPI‑SPN (Entailment spine).**
  Identify the **premise/lemma spine** for the claim; `R_raw = min R_i` is taken along this spine, not over arbitrary satellites.

* **EPI‑MAP (Semantic mapping congruence).**
  Point to the **vocabulary/ontology mappings** used; their verification status sets the **CL** levels on the integration edges.

#### B.3:5.4 - Γ\_ctx / Γ\_method (order‑sensitive) — additional obligations

* **CTX‑ORD (OrderSpec).**
  Attach the partial or total order `σ` and any **join‑soundness** conditions (types, pre/post‑conditions).
  (See B.1.4 for NC‑1..3 invariants; B.1.5 adds duration/capability typing.)

#### B.3:5.5 - Γ\_time (temporal) — additional obligations

* **TIME‑COV (Coverage & identity).**
  Show that `PhaseOf` intervals cover the declared window without overlap for the **same carrier**; justify any gap/overlap explicitly.

> **Note on Γ\_work.**
> Resource spending and efficiency live in **Γ\_work**. Their *measurement integrity* can influence **R** for a claim (e.g., if a reliability figure depends on calibrated energy input), but **costs themselves are not assurance**; keep them in Γ\_work and cite their **measurement assurance** as inputs here.


### B.3:6 - Archetypal grounding (worked examples)

#### B.3:6.1 - System archetype — **Battery pack safety claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Pack P meets discharge current L with thermal safety margin δ in environment K.*
* **Context `K`:** Ambient ≤ 35 °C; airflow ≥ X; duty cycle Y. Scope `S = run`.
* **Graph:** Cells `ComponentOf` modules `ComponentOf` pack; BIC exposes main power and thermal interface.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F` per node: module spec F2, cell test F1 → `F_eff = F1`.
  * `G`: operating envelope regions; union constrained by supported test regimes.
  * `R`: per‑module reliability from test data; cutset is **hot‑spot path** near weakest cell.
  * `CL`: interface congruence (sensor calibration CL2; thermal contact CL1).
* **Aggregation:**

  * `R_raw = min R_i` along the thermal cutset.
  * `R_eff = max(0, R_raw − Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of supported (L,T) rectangles, dropping regions lacking validated thermal data.
  * `F_eff = min(F_cell=F1, F_module=F2) = F1`.
* **SCR:** Evidence for calibration, test campaigns, BIC.
* **Improvement path:** raise `CL` (better thermal interface verification), raise `F` (formal thermal model), add supported envelope → **R\_eff** and **G\_eff** increase monotonically.

#### B.3:6.2 - Episteme archetype — **Meta‑analysis claim**

* **Claim `C`:** *Intervention X reduces outcome O by Δ on population P.*
* **Context `K`:** Inclusion/exclusion criteria, measurement protocol; `S = design`.
* **Graph:** Studies `MemberOf` evidence corpus; effect models `ConstituentOf` synthesis; mappings align different outcome scales.
* **Inputs:**

  * `F`: two RCTs at F3, one observational at F2 → `F_eff = F2`.
  * `R`: per‑study replication/quality → weakest R on the entailment spine caps `R_raw`.
  * `CL`: mapping of scales (CL1 vs CL3).
  * `G`: populations union, but unsupported sub‑populations are dropped.
* **Aggregation:**
* **Aggregation:**  
* **\[M‑1]** ordinal support ranking; note weakest‑link study.  
* **\[M‑2]** compute `R_eff` with Φ table; record `CL_min` for scale mappings.  
* **\[F‑constructive]** formalise the effect‑model equivalence and export proof‑term hash.  # [M/F]

  * `R_eff = max(0, min(R_RCT1, R_RCT2, R_OBS) − Φ(CL_min=CL1))`.
  * `G_eff`: union of supported sub‑populations; out‑of‑scope groups excluded.
* **SCR:** Data provenance, scale mappings, bias assessment.
* **Improvement path:** upgrade mapping verification to CL2/CL3; increase `F` via registered analysis plan; replicate lagging study.

#### B.3:6.3 - Order/Process archetype — **Manufacturing route assurance**

* **Claim `C`:** *Route R meets output defect rate ≤ ε.*
* **Context `K`:** Materials, equipment class; `S = run`.
* **Γ\_ctx artifacts:** `σ` order; declared independent branches; join conditions at inspection.
* **Assurance:**

  * `R_raw = min R_step` along the **critical path** (includes inspection effectiveness).
  * Penalty from poor join soundness `CL_min`.
  * Improvement via faster but **verified** inspection (↑R\_step) or tighter join spec (↑CL).

#### B.3:6.4 - Temporal archetype — **Versioned model credibility**

* **Claim `C`:** *Model M predicts within ±δ over τ.*
* **Context `K`:** Data regime and drift tolerance; `S = run`.
* **Γ\_time artifacts:** `PhaseOf` slices v1, v2, v3 covering `τ`.
* **Assurance:**

  * `R_raw = min(R_v1, R_v2, R_v3)`;
  * penalty if v2–v3 interface had low calibration congruence;
  * improvement via re‑calibration (↑CL) or new validation campaign (↑R\_v3).

| **Coverage as centroid** | Replacing `G` union with a single “typical point”          | Keep `G` as set/coverage; if a numeric proxy is needed, derive it from the set.                                |
| **Ignoring congruence**  | No penalty for weak mappings/interfaces                    | Assign `CL` to integration edges; apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **Design/run chimera**   | “One score” mixing blueprint and telemetry                 | Split into `S=design` and `S=run` tuples; compare explicitly.                                                  |
| **Agency override**      | Claiming higher assurance because a controller is “clever” | Agency may justify *how* improvements are achieved; it cannot remove WLNK or `Φ`.                              |
| **MemberOf as stock**    | Using `MemberOf` to sum reliabilities                      | Keep `MemberOf` for collections; reliability comes from the relevant **Γ** composition (e.g., Γ\_sys cutset). |


### B.3:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* **Comparable, conservative, improvable.** The tuple ⟨F, G, R⟩ with **edge‑level CL** gives a compact, auditable view that improves monotonically under targeted actions (formalize, replicate, reconcile).
* **Cross‑scale coherence.** Works for assemblies and arguments, procedures and histories, without leaking order/time/cost into structure.
* **Clear upgrade paths.** It is obvious **what to do** to raise each component (raise F/G/R locally or raise CL on the glue).

**Trade‑offs**

* **More explicit metadata.** You must state scale kinds, cutsets, and mapping congruence; this is intentional transparency.
* **Conservatism may feel pessimistic.** True synergy appears only via **MHT** or after raising CL—never by arithmetic optimism.


### B.3:10 - Rationale (informative)

B.3 distills mature post‑2015 practice across several fields into a single, small calculus:

* **Assurance by weakest link** reflects reliability engineering and safety cases in complex systems; composing claim strength by minima prevents over‑statement.
* **Formality and verifiability** mirror advances in model‑based engineering and formal verification, where raising F turns subjective arguments into verifiable artifacts.
* **Coverage as set/measure** follows evidence synthesis and validation practice that treat applicability as a domain region, not a scalar to “average.”
* **Congruence on edges** captures what meta‑analysis, interface control, and ontology alignment have repeatedly shown: integration quality is often the real bottleneck. Penalizing low‑CL is a principled way to prevent silent over‑confidence while rewarding verified reconciliation.

This arrangement preserves **A.11 Parsimony** (few characteristics), aligns with **A.14/A.15** (clear separation of structure, order, time, cost, values), and leaves Context for domain‑specific refinements that do not break the invariants.


### B.3:11 - Relations

* **Builds on:** B.1 (Universal Γ), B.1.1 (Proof Kit), B.1.2 (Γ_sys & BIC), B.1.3 (Γ_epist & SCR), B.1.4 (Γ_ctx/Γ_time), A.12 (Transformer), A.14 (Mereology), A.15 (Strict Distinction), **C.13 (Compose‑CAL)**.
* * **Coordinates with:** **E.14 (Human‑Centric Working‑Model)** for publication‑surface discipline and **B.3.5 (CT2R‑LOG)** for Working‑Model relation aliasing and grounding (`tv:*`, `validationMode`).
* **Used by:** KD‑CAL action patterns (to plan improvements), B.4 (Evolution loops that raise F/G/R or CL over time).
* **Triggers:** B.2 (Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT): Recognizing Emergence and Re‑identifying Wholes) when genuine new capabilities emerge that change the applicable cutsets or envelopes.

> **One‑page takeaway.**
> Report assurance as **⟨F, G, R⟩** for a **typed claim** under explicit **context/scope**, and penalize by the **lowest edge‑level congruence**.
> Improve assurance by raising **F**, **G**, **R**, or **CL**—and keep order, time, and cost in their own lanes.
