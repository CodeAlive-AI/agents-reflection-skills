## C.16 - Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR)

### C.16:1 - Intent (Normative)

**Name.** *Measurement & Metrics Characterization (MM‑CHR).* This is a user‑oriented name: in user‑facing narrative we may say *metrics*; in **Tech** register we speak **Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate / Value / Score / Unit / ScoringMethod**; in **Formal** register we use `U.DHCMethod(Ref)` / `U.Measure` / `U.Unit` / `U.EvidenceStub`.
**Intent.** Provide a **transdisciplinary substrate for measurement** that any FPF pattern can rely on: a small, stable set of intensional constructs and relations—**`U.DHCMethodRef`**, **`U.Measure`**, **`U.Unit`**, **`U.EvidenceStub`**—disciplined by **CSLC** (*Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate*) so that every recorded value is **interpretable**, and any claim of “comparability” is **auditable** (physics lab time‑of‑flight, figure‑skating judging, architectural modularity, etc.). **C.16** does **not** re‑define **Characteristic** (A.17) nor the CSLC kernel Standard (A.18); instead, it **exports** the measurement substrate that *binds* an FPF pattern’s measurable notions to **one Characteristic and one Scale** and frames a **conceptual link to evidence**. This characterization is **notation‑neutral**, **tool‑agnostic**, and **open‑ended** (no “lifecycle” narrative; evolution proceeds via **RSG** moves with checklists).

**One‑minute mental model (didactic; non‑normative).**
* **Template** (`U.DHCMethod`) says what a value *means*: the **Characteristic**, **Scale** (and **Unit** when applicable), plus **polarity** and applicability.
* **Reading** (`U.Measure`) says what was claimed about a **subject**: a value on that Scale, with a **time stance** and (when required) an **EvidenceStub**.
* **Direct comparability** is conservative: *same template*; everything else requires a **named, cited** transformation or equivalence owner.

**Non‑ownership boundary (single‑writer).** C.16 is **not** the semantic owner for (i) characterization mechanisms (e.g., normalization / indicatorization / scoring / comparison / selection), (ii) any normalization/equivalence notions (method tokens, “invariant value” notions, equivalence relations), (iii) contract routing policies (comparability modes, legality gates), or (iv) suite protocol obligations. Those belong to their single owners (e.g., the CN/CG contract surfaces and the CHR mechanism owner patterns). C.16 may **cite** such owners when motivating evidence or interpretability, but MUST NOT introduce or restate their terminology or laws.

**Outcomes.**
(1) A uniform way for FPF patterns to *declare* what is measured and *read* what has been measured; (2) explicit **Characteristic anchoring** and **Scale typing** per CSLC; (3) principled **comparability** and **polarity** (declared at the template level); (4) **traceability** via conceptual evidence stubs; (5) seamless alignment with cross‑domain quantity notions (ISO 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN, Verspoor) through Unification rows (Part F). 

### C.16:2 - Scope & Status (Normative)

**Scope.** **C.16** specifies the **measurement substrate** for FPF patterns: the roles of `U.DHCMethodRef`, `U.Measure`, `U.Unit`, `U.EvidenceStub`; their **CSLC discipline** (by reference to A.17/A.18); and **evidence linkage semantics** at the level of *conceptual conditions*. It defines **direct interpretability** and **direct comparability** (same template), and it equips other patterns to state—and audit—stronger comparability claims by **citing** their single owners. It **exports** these constructs for all FPF patterns (KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL, etc.) without prescribing domain formulae, procedures, or any CHR mechanism semantics.

**Status.** **Normative** C.16 **depends on** A.17 (canonical **Characteristic**) and A.18 (minimal **CSLC** in Kernel). Where C.16 cites external CG‑frames, the stance is through **Part F** rows and **Bridges** (with CL and loss notes), not by vocabulary import. 

**Out of scope.** No computational recipes, no workflow prescriptions, no governance/process guidance. No definitions of normalization/indicatorization/scoring/comparison/selection mechanisms, no comparability routing policies, and no legality gate specifications. C.16 concerns **objects of thought** (intensions) and their **validity conditions** for measurement claims, not records or tooling. (Implementation guidance, if any, belongs outside Part C.)


### C.16:3 - Problem & Context (Informative)

#### C.16:3.1 - The problem C.16 solves

Across FPF patterns, people say “score”, “metric”, “rating”, “property”. Without a shared substrate, numbers drift: *42 of what? on which scale? comparable to whom?* C.16 eliminates drift by requiring every metric notion to **bind** to **one** Characteristic and **one** Scale, and by **separating** intensional anchors from descriptions and ScoringMethods. The result is **portable meaning**: a measure is always readable as a **Coordinate on a declared Scale of a named Characteristic**, with a principled path to evidence. 

#### C.16:3.2 - Context and prior art

* **Kernel canon.** A.17 makes **Characteristic** the sole canonical anchor for measurability; A.18 fixes **CSLC** as the minimal sufficiency for interpretability. C.16 relies on both.
* **Cross‑domain alignment.** The MM‑CHR family already maps FPF U.Types to **ISO 80000‑1 (Quantity)**, **ISO/IEC 25024 (Data‑quality Characteristic)**, **QUDT (QuantityKind/QuantityValue)**, **W3C SOSA/SSN (Observable/Observed/Result)**, and domain “feature/metric” usage (Verspoor, TF Metrics). C.16 uses these rows **as Bridges** (Part F), preserving local senses and documenting losses.  
* **Open‑ended evolution.** FPF replaces “lifecycle” with **Role‑State Graph (RSG)** style state checklists (A.2.5): movement is along **certified states** with checklists; re‑entry is allowed when distinctions change. C.16 uses this device only to frame **readiness** and **revision** of metric notions conceptually (no processes implied).


### C.16:4 - Forces (Informative)

**F1 — Interpretability first.** A value detached from its Characteristic/Scale is meaningless; CSLC supplies minimum context.
**F2 — Transdisciplinarity.** Physics, architecture, curation, sport judging—*one* substrate must cover all while respecting scale types and polarity.
**F3 — Intension vs description.** Confusing the **Characteristic** (intensional object) with its rubric or exemplar text (descriptions) corrupts claims; C.16 keeps them distinct.
**F4 — Comparability without coercion.** Ordinal ≠ interval; ratio admits unit change, ordinal does not; polarity matters for “better/worse”. C.16 encodes these **as conceptual constraints**, not formulas.
**F5 — Evidence sufficiency.** A measure should be *checkable in principle*; evidence is a **conceptual link** (not storage advice).
**F6 — Lexical discipline.** One canon in normative register; narrative labels are didactic only (Part E). C.16 reuses E.10’s **register mapping**.


### C.16:5 - Solution Outline (Normative)

**S1 — Exported objects.** C.16 **exports** four intensional constructs to be used by any FPF pattern:

1. **`U.DHCMethod`** — a *measurement template* (a Definition) that binds **one `U.Characteristic`** to **one Scale form**, with declared **polarity** and (optionally) a **citation point** to the semantic owner of any non‑trivial equivalence/comparability claim that is relied upon elsewhere (e.g., a Bridge or a declared transformation owner). **References** to this template use `U.DHCMethodRef`. It is an *intensional specification*, not a record layout.
2. **`U.Measure`** — an *assertion* that a **subject** occupies a **Coordinate** (or **Level**, if discrete) on that Scale; the measure **references** its template and carries a **conceptual pointer to evidence** (`U.EvidenceStub`).
3. **`U.Unit`** — the *unit kind* associated with the Scale where applicable (physical quantities, normalized “points”, “stars”, “%”); unit coherence is part of comparability conditions.
4. **`U.EvidenceStub`** — a *conceptual locator* of grounds for the asserted value (type, identifier, brief summary, optional integrity notion); sufficiency criteria are **conceptual** (see §9, later).

**S2 — Comparability stance (boundary‑aware).** C.16 states only the **direct** comparability condition for measurement claims: *same template* (hence, same Characteristic + Scale + Unit semantics by reference to A.17/A.18). Any comparability claim that relies on transformations (normalization, scoring, aggregation, cross‑context transport, bridge losses, legality gating) MUST cite its single semantic owner (CN/CG surfaces and/or the relevant mechanism cards). C.16 does not define those transformations or their laws. (Details: §7–§8 in later parts.)

**S3 — Evidence stance.** A measure that, by its template, **requires** evidence, is **inadmissible** without a meaningful `U.EvidenceStub`. C.16 defines **what it means conceptually** for evidence to “connect” the subject, the Characteristic, and its symbolic description; mechanisms are out of scope. (Details: §9 in later parts.)

**S4 — RSG framing (open‑endedness).** Readiness, calibration, and revision of metric notions are expressed as **RSG node moves with checklists** (e.g., “characteristic anchored”, “Scale typed”, “Unit coherent”, “ScoringMethod declared”), allowing **re‑entry** when distinctions change; there is no terminal “lifecycle”. (Details: §10, later.)


#### C.16:5.1 - Lexical Discipline & Registers (Normative)

**L1 — Canon.** Use **Characteristic / Scale / Level / Coordinate / Value / Score / Unit / ScoringMethod** in **Tech** register; their `U.*` counterparts in **Formal**. Narrative labels (e.g., *axis*, *points*, *stars*) are **didactic only**, and are mapped at first mention to the Tech canon (E.10). 
**L1‑bis — “metric”.** The noun *metric* is **not** a Tech‑register canonical token for measurables; use **Characteristic / Scale / Coordinate / Score / ScoringMethod**. It **may** appear in the pattern title and in the Formal names `U.DHCMethodRef` / `U.Measure`. Do not use *metric* as a synonym for **Characteristic** or **Score** in normative prose.
**L2 — Intension vs Description.** Keep **intensional objects** (`U.DHCMethodRef`, `U.Characteristic`) distinct from **descriptions** (rubrics, exemplars) and from **claims** (`U.Measure`). No collapsing of names across these layers.
**L3 — No synonym sprawl.** In normative clauses do **not** substitute *dimension/axis/property/feature* for **Characteristic**; A.17 governs canonicalization. (C.16 inherits A.17’s rename policy.)
**L4 — Bridge‑only unification.** Cross‑vocabulary sameness appears only via **F.9 Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; C.16’s lexicon is the *source* side for measurement rows.
**L5 — Plain‑register shorthand.** In **Plain** register *metric* MAY be used as shorthand for “template + readings”, but on first use it MUST be mapped to **`U.DHCMethod` (template)** and **`U.Measure` (reading)**, and to the Tech canon terms that matter for meaning.
**L6 — No CHR‑mechanism terminology ownership.** Tokens and laws owned by characterization mechanisms (e.g., normalization method tokens, invariant‑value notions, indicatorization policy terms) MUST be introduced only by their owner patterns. C.16 may mention them only as **cited** external terms, never as locally defined canon.

#### C.16:5.2 - Relations (pointers; details later)

**To A.17 / A.18.** C.16 *uses* A.17’s canonical **Characteristic** and A.18’s **CSLC sufficiency**; it neither re‑states nor weakens them.
**To Part F.** C.16 is the **exporting pattern** behind measurement rows in UTS/Bridges (e.g., **result‑value** ↔ SOSA `Result`, ISO `QuantityValue`).
**To Arch‑CAL.** Architectural qualities (*Coupling, Cohesion, Evolvability*) become **Characteristics** measured via C.16 templates; architectural dynamics read as trajectories in **CharacteristicSpace** (A.17 context).

#### C.16:5.3 - Normative Core Model (types & Standards)

> **Position.** MM‑CHR does **not** redefine kernel terms; it **binds** them to an FPF‑level Standard that every metric must satisfy. Canonical vocabulary and CSLC duties are inherited from **A.17**/**A.18** and referenced here without duplication.
> 
> **Source of Truth** A.17/A.18 are the sole sources of truth for Canon and CSLC; C.16 **adopts by reference** and **forbids restatements** of their definitions. C.16 only **exports** `U.*` constructs, comparability stance, evidence semantics, and RSG touch‑points.
>
> **CHR boundary reminder.** Any notion that belongs to characterization mechanisms (normalization, indicatorization, scoring, aggregation, comparison, selection) appears in C.16 only as a **pointer** to its semantic owner. C.16 MUST NOT become a shadow owner for any such terminology or laws.

##### C.16:5.3.1 - `U.DHCMethod` — the metric definition (normative)

##### C.16:5.3.1 - `U.DHCMethod` — the measurement template (normative)

**Role.** An intensional **Standard** that fixes *what is measured* and *how values must be read*—without producing any values itself. It is a *Definition*, not a Measure. **References** to this template use `U.DHCMethodRef`. *(Didactic: think “the meaning contract for a reading”.)*

**R‑MT‑1 (CSLC anchor).** A DHCMethod **SHALL** bind to **exactly one** `U.Characteristic` and **exactly one** **Scale‑form** admissible for that Characteristic (cf. A.18). Level is **optional** (used when the scale is enumerated); otherwise values are given directly as Coordinates.

**R‑MT‑2 (Unit).** If the scale carries units (interval/ratio), the template **SHALL** designate a **Unit** of presentation. For ordinal/nominal scales, unit may be absent or a nominal label (e.g., “stars”). (Old MM‑CHR Annex A already listed these structural elements; here we fix the conceptual obligation. )

**R‑MT‑3 (Polarity).** For any ordered scale, the template **SHALL** declare polarity (*higher‑is‑better / lower‑is‑better / target‑is‑best*), as a semantic reading aid and as an input to consuming patterns. If polarity is *target‑is‑best*, the template **SHALL** name the target value (or target set) and MAY cite (by reference) the semantic owner of any tolerance/fall‑off convention used by downstream mechanisms or methods. C.16 does **not** standardize tolerance/fall‑off semantics; those belong to the semantic owner of the relevant scoring/normalization/selection mechanism or method description.

**R‑MT‑4 (Applicability).** A template **SHALL** state the **applicability frame** (what kinds of subjects it meaningfully applies to) in conceptual terms; this is a property of the definition, not of any measure.

**R‑MT‑5 (Intension vs description).** The template is an **intensional object**. Any rubric, checklist, or prose that explains it is a **Description**; they are related but not identical (E.10 discipline).

**R‑MT‑6 (Cardinality hint).** A Template **MAY** declare its intended **cardinality semantics** for a subject within a **time stance** (e.g., *latest‑only*, *at‑most‑one‑per‑day*, *time series*).
Where declared, claims outside that semantics are **inadmissible conceptually** (they must be reframed or versioned). *Purpose:* prevent silent duplicates and mixed regimes without imposing storage logic.

**R‑MT‑7 (MAY).** `UncertaintyPolicy` — optional conceptual guidance on how uncertainty is expressed/read (e.g., band/CI/quantile), without prescribing methods/tools.
*(Informative examples: calibrated probability with a confidence band; a prediction interval; a set‑valued reading such as a prediction set.)*
    

##### C.16:5.3.2 - `U.Measure` — the recorded reading (normative)

**Role.** A **claim** that a subject occupies a **Coordinate** (or named **Level**) on the template’s scale, backed by a minimal pointer to its grounds.

**R‑ME‑1 (Template binding).** Every Measure **SHALL** reference exactly one DHCMethodRef; its **Value/Coordinate** must be **valid** for that template’s scale (type, range, category).

**R‑ME‑2 (Subject).** A Measure **SHALL** identify its **subject‑of‑measurement** (the bearer) unambiguously in the same Context of meaning as the template’s applicability frame.

**R‑ME‑3 (Evidence stub).** Where the template requires it, a Measure **SHALL** include an **EvidenceStub**—a conceptual pointer sufficient to support independent reasoning about the claim’s origin. (The old spec framed this as “traceability/provenance”; we keep only the **conceptual** role here. )

**R‑ME‑4 (Time stance).** A Measure **SHALL** carry a **time stance** (e.g., “as‑observed at T”, or “as‑aggregated over W”), expressed conceptually; it disambiguates the reading’s intended window without prescribing formats.

**R‑ME‑5 (Entity vs relation).** If the Characteristic is **relational**, the subject is a **tuple** (pair, k‑tuple); the wording of the claim reflects that arity and the template’s relation topology (cf. A.17).

**R‑ME‑6 (MAY).** `UncertaintyStub` — optional conceptual pointer to the adopted uncertainty estimation for this Measure, **if** required by the template.

> *Informative anchor.* The old Annex B example “Article Completeness” illustrates the split template/measure/evidence; **C.16** keeps the split but forbids storage‑level talk.

##### C.16:5.3.3 - `U.Unit` — semantics of quantities (normative)

**Role.** A conceptual marker of **quantity kind** and admissible **conversions** within that kind; not every scale requires it.

**R‑UN‑1 (Quantity kind).** Where units apply, the template **SHALL** indicate the **quantity kind** (e.g., Time, Length, Dimensionless‑Score). Units are meaningful only **within** one kind.

**R‑UN‑2 (Convertibility).** Comparisons across different units are permitted **iff** they are **convertible** by kind‑preserving transformation (ratio/interval scales); for ordinal/nominal scales, no numeric conversions exist. (Old Annex A listed conversion hints; here we assert the conceptual boundary. )

**R‑UN‑3 (Canonical labels).** `%` denotes “fraction×100”; “points” denotes dimensionless magnitudes used for scores; “stars” denotes discrete ordinal marks. These are **labels** of representation, not new characteristics.

**R‑UN‑4 (Quantity‑kind bridge).** A Template on an interval/ratio Scale **SHOULD** name the underlying **quantity kind** (e.g., ISO 80000/QUDT category) to enable safe external bridges. This does **not** import external vocabularies; it declares an alignment point.

##### C.16:5.3.4 - `U.EvidenceStub` — pointer to grounds (normative)

**Role.** A compact **tie** from a Measure to the grounds sufficient for **reasoned audit** (not a repository prescription).

**R‑EV‑1 (Minimal sufficiency).** An EvidenceStub **SHALL** carry, at minimum, a **type‑of‑ground** and an **identifier** sufficient to retrieve or reconstruct the grounds in the appropriate Context of meaning.

**R‑EV‑2 (Compositionality).** Multiple grounds may be **composed** as a finite set; composition is **commutative/associative/idempotent** at the level of stubs, enabling conceptual merge of corroborations.

**R‑EV‑3 (Soundness axiom).** A Measure is **MM‑CHR‑admissible** only if at least one **auditable chain of grounds** can be stated from the bearer to the Characteristic via an appropriate Description (Object–Concept–Symbol triangle in the episteme). *(Note:* mechanism‑level admissibility gates (e.g., legality/evidence thresholds in CG‑frames or CHR mechanisms) are owned elsewhere; C.16 defines only the conceptual “has grounds” link.)
**R‑EV‑3 (Soundness axiom).** A Measure is **MM‑CHR‑admissible** only if at least one **auditable chain of grounds** can be stated that connects:
`bearer (subject) → grounds → Characteristic → Coordinate/Level on the declared Scale`,
in the appropriate Context of meaning. *(Informative: this is the object–concept–symbol triangle.)*  
*(Boundary note:* mechanism‑level admissibility gates (e.g., legality/evidence thresholds in CG‑frames or CHR mechanisms) are owned elsewhere; C.16 defines only the conceptual “has grounds” link.)

#### C.16:5.4 - Polarity, Comparability, and ScoringMethods (normative)

> **Notation.** To avoid clashes with the kernel’s global aggregation symbol, this FPF pattern denotes a **ScoringMethod** (score‑level mapping) by **𝒢** (calligraphic 𝒢).

**R‑POL‑1 (Declared polarity).** Every ordered scale **SHALL** declare polarity at the **template**. Any disclosed scoring method **𝒢** that issues a **Score** for that template **SHALL** be order‑compatible with the declared polarity semantics (monotone for ↑/↓ polarity; target‑aware only when the target semantics is explicitly declared and cited where it depends on external conventions).

**R‑CMP‑1 (Direct comparability).** Two readings are **directly comparable** only when they reference the **same `U.DHCMethodRef`** (hence share Characteristic + Scale + Unit semantics by reference to A.17/A.18). “Same‑template” is the only comparability relation defined by C.16.
*(Clarification:* sharing a name, unit label, or scale type across distinct templates is **not** sufficient for comparability in MM‑CHR; cross‑template comparability must be established via **R‑CMP‑2**.)*

**R‑CMP‑2 (Transformed comparability is cited, not defined).** If a comparison relies on any transformation or routing step (e.g., normalization, indicatorization, scoring, aggregation, cross‑context transport, bridge conversions, legality gates), that step **SHALL** be **named and cited** via its single semantic owner. C.16 does not define such transformations, their law sets, or their admissibility conditions.

**R‑G𝒢‑1 (ScoringMethod disclosure).** If a pattern issues a **Score** (a value on a score scale), its scoring method **𝒢 : Coordinate → Score** **SHALL** be identified **by reference** to its semantic owner (e.g., a method description card), and SHALL disclose:
(i) a **bounded codomain** / score range, and  
(ii) an explicit **order‑compatibility statement** (e.g., monotonicity) consistent with the template’s declared polarity.  
When reproducibility matters, the reference SHOULD be edition‑pinned (per the owner’s authoring discipline).  
C.16 does not define scoring methods; it only requires that a score be interpretable as a reading on a declared scale.

**R‑G𝒢‑2 (Ordinal respect).** For ordinal inputs, any cited scoring method must be **order‑preserving**; interval assumptions **MUST NOT** be smuggled in. *(Normative source for scale legality remains A.18; C.16 only enforces “no silent semantics upgrade”.)*


#### C.16:5.5 - Entity vs Relation bindings (normative clarifications)

**R‑ER‑1 (Arity preservation).** If the Characteristic is `U.EntityCharacteristic`, the subject is **one** bearer; if `U.RelationCharacteristic`, the subject is a **k‑tuple** (k ≥ 2). The Measure’s claim text **SHALL** reflect this arity.

**R‑ER‑2 (Relation scale).** Relation‑valued scales **SHALL** fix their symmetry/antisymmetry and directionality (e.g., distance symmetric; influence directional), at the **template** level.

**R‑ER‑3 (Bridge to CG‑frames).** In architectural CG‑frames, **Coupling/Cohesion** are Characteristics over **modules** (structure) or **roles** (function). Their measures are relational (**Coupling**) or unary (**Cohesion** within an element), but both live in the same MM‑CHR substrate. (Alignment hinted in the old mapping rows across contexts. )


#### C.16:5.6 - Acceptance (conceptual, RSG‑aware)

> Acceptance here is **thought‑level**. It uses the **Role‑State Graph (A.2.5)** pattern to organise mental checks—no “lifecycle” narratives.

**SCR‑C16‑A (Template sufficiency).** You can check—without invoking tooling—that the template has:
(i) a fixed **Characteristic** (A.17),  
(ii) a typed **Scale form** (A.18), and  
(iii) coherent **Unit** semantics where applicable (plus declared polarity for ordered scales).

**SCR‑C16‑B (Reading sufficiency).** For a given subject, you can check that the reading:
(i) cites the template,  
(ii) states a value valid for the Scale (Coordinate/Level),  
(iii) states a time stance,  
(iv) names **𝒢** when a Score is issued, and  
(v) provides EvidenceStub(s) where the template requires them.

**SCR‑C16‑C (Comparability).** When two readings are placed side‑by‑side, you can state in one breath whether they are **comparable as‑is** or only **after 𝒢**, and **why**.

**SCR‑C16‑D (Evidence adequacy).** For any required EvidenceStub, you can sketch at least one **auditable chain of grounds** from the subject to the Characteristic via a Description in the right Context.


#### C.16:5.7 Cross‑references & anchors

* **A.17 (CHR‑NORM).** Canonical **Characteristic** and Entity/Relation split; lexical rules and alias sunset.
* **A.18 (CSLC‑KERNEL).** One Characteristic + one Scale per template; Level optional; operation guard by scale type.
* **Annex C (old MM‑CHR).** Cross‑domain alignment hints for Characteristics/Observations/Quantities across ISO 80000, ISO/IEC 25024, QUDT, SOSA/SSN (used here only as conceptual witnesses).

### C.16:6 - Scale‑type legality quick reference (Informative)

> **Didactic note.** This table is a memory aid for engineers and managers. It does **not** introduce new legality rules. Normative legality of operations by scale type is owned by **A.18 (CSLC)** (and, where mechanized in CG‑frames, by the relevant legality profiles).
> If any row below conflicts with A.18, treat it as an illustrative example and follow A.18.

| Scale type   | Comparisons    | Location          | Differences        | Ratios                   | Admissible summaries                                  | Typical anti‑patterns (forbidden)                                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nominal**  | =, ≠           | mode, frequencies | —                  | —                        | counts, proportions                                   | averaging labels; ordering categories without a declared order      |
| **Ordinal**  | <, =, > (rank) | median, quantiles | **not meaningful** | —                        | order‑respecting summaries (median rank, percentiles) | arithmetic mean of ranks; variance on ranks; linear blends of ranks |
| **Interval** | <, =, >        | mean location     | Δ meaningful       | ratio **not** meaningful | mean, sd of **differences**, correlation              | ratio claims (“twice as hot” in °C); geometric mean                 |
| **Ratio**    | <, =, >        | mean location     | Δ meaningful       | ratios meaningful        | arithmetic/geometric means, cv, growth rates          | adding heterogeneous units; log on nonpositive values               |

**Reminders (informative; see A.18 for normative rules).**
G‑1 (Order). On ordinal, transforms should be **monotone**.
G‑2 (Differences). On interval/ratio, **Δ** is meaningful; on ordinal/nominal, it is undefined.
G‑3 (Ratios). Only ratio Scales admit **x/y** semantics; interval/ordinal/nominal do not.
G‑4 (Unit coherence). Interval/ratio arithmetic presumes compatible units (or a declared conversion).
G‑5 (Target polarity). If polarity is targeted, comparisons use distance‑from‑target semantics as declared by the relevant owner (template + cited method/mechanism).

*(These rules line up with the MM‑CHR exposition of CSLC and term discipline; A.17 fixes the lexical side.)* 

### C.16:7 - Evidence Semantics (Normative)

#### C.16:7.1 - What an Evidence Stub is (and is not)

**Definition.** `U.EvidenceStub` is a **conceptual pointer** that ties a **measure** to the **grounds** sufficient for independent checking (observations, arguments, lawful transformations). It is not the run log, not the carrier, and not the intensional characteristic itself. This keeps **intension–description–specification** distinct per E.10.D2 and the Clarity Lattice.

**Rule Σ‑1.** Whether evidence is **required** is a **property of the metric template**; if required, each `U.Measure` **SHALL** include an `U.EvidenceStub`.
**Rule Σ‑2.** Evidence composition is **commutative, associative, idempotent** at the concept level (sets/multisets of grounds); combining grounds can never *reduce* what is knowable about the measure’s warrant.
**Rule Σ‑3.** *Soundness minimum:* there exists a conceptual chain linking **bearer → Characteristic → Scale/Unit → admissible method/episteme**. (No “free‑floating numbers”.)
**Rule Σ‑4.** Any declared *agreement* construct used as evidence (e.g., dual readings, panels) **SHALL** respect the template’s scale type (per A.18) (e.g., order‑based concordance for ordinal; tolerance‑based agreement for interval/ratio).
**Note (boundary).** CG‑frame evidence thresholds (e.g., “minimal evidence” gates used by selection/scoring/comparison mechanisms) are owned elsewhere. C.16 defines only the EvidenceStub semantics that such gates may cite.
*Anchors:* MM‑CHR units/evidence notion; Strict Distinction and the separation of objects from their descriptions/specs.


### C.16:8 - Integration with RSG & Dynamics (Normative/Clarifying)

#### C.16:8.1 - RSG (Role‑State Graph) touch‑points

MM‑CHR **supplies recognisers** used in **State Checklists**. A checklist criterion **may** refer to a measure (e.g., “Cohesion ≥ T on ordinal ladder”), but the **state itself remains intensional**; the checklist is its **description**, and a **StateAssertion** is an evidence‑backed verdict over a Window. No lifecycle language is implied; RSGs are open‑ended graphs with re‑entry edges.

**Rule RSG‑M1.** When a checklist cites a measure, it **SHALL** do so by **Characteristic + Scale semantics** (and unit if applicable), not by colloquial aliases; Tech/Formal registers apply. **Rule RSG‑M2.** Thresholds in checklists **MUST** respect the scale type (no ratio talk on interval scales; no arithmetic on ordinal ladders).

#### C.16:8.2 - Dynamics & CharacteristicSpace

`U.Dynamics.stateSpace` is a **CharacteristicSpace**—a named set of Characteristics with units/topology. MM‑CHR provides the **measurement side** of that space; patterns specify the **transition law**. Architectural or epistemic **dynamics** are then *trajectories in the declared CharacteristicSpace*. **No** procedural or storage commitments are implied.

### C.16:9 - Conformance Checklist (Normative)

> *Thought‑level acceptance conditions for authors and reviewers; they constrain meaning, not tooling.*

**CC‑MCHR‑1 - CSLC anchoring.** Each `U.DHCMethodRef` binds **exactly one** `U.Characteristic` and **exactly one** scale; each `U.Measure` carries a value valid for that scale (cf. A.18).
**CC‑MCHR‑2 - Polarity declared.** Every **ordered** scale in a template declares **polarity**; any **Score** via 𝒢 is monotone w.r.t. that polarity.
**CC‑MCHR‑3 - Unit coherence.** Claims that compare or combine values are **grounded in unit coherence** (or declared conversions for interval/ratio).
**CC‑MCHR‑4 - Comparability honesty.** Ordered comparisons are asserted **only** when **R‑CMP‑1** holds (same‑template direct comparability) or when a **named, cited** transformation owner is provided per **R‑CMP‑2**; otherwise authors use qualitative/set‑level language.
**CC‑MCHR‑5 - Evidence sufficiency.** Where evidence is required by the template, the measure’s grounds are **conceptually sufficient** to retrace the claim; composition respects **Σ‑1…Σ‑4**.
**CC‑MCHR‑6 - RSG alignment.** If a measure gates a **state** in an RSG, the checklist criteria **respect scale semantics** and the **intensional vs description** split. No lifecycle phrasing; use RSG open‑ended moves.
**CC‑MCHR‑7 - Dynamics awareness.** Where discussions involve change, the **CharacteristicSpace** is **named** (characteristics, units, topology) and separated from the **transition law**.
**CC‑MCHR‑8 - Lexical guard‑rails.** Tech identifiers and headings use **Characteristic/Scale/Level/Value/Score/Unit/ScoringMethod**; aliases (axis/dimension/points/stars) appear **only** in explanatory Plain register with a first‑mention mapping to the Tech canon.

### C.16:10 - Invariants & Anti‑Patterns *(Normative unless marked “Informative”)*

#### C.16:10.1 - Invariants (N‑rules)

**N‑1 — One Characteristic + one Scale per template.**
Every `U.DHCMethodRef` binds *exactly one* **Characteristic** and *exactly one* **Scale** (its type + admissible range or level‑set). This is the CSLC sufficiency condition for interpretability.

**N‑2 — Value validity.**
A `U.Measure` holds a **Value** that is *admissible* for the template’s Scale (numeric range, categorical level); when a **Level** is used, it is among the named rungs declared for that Scale.

**N‑3 — Polarity is declared at the template.**
For ordered Scales, the template states the comparison direction (↑ better / ↓ better / target‑is‑best). Any **ScoringMethod mapping** to **Score** preserves that monotonic ordering. *(Note: we use “ScoringMethod mapping” instead of the Greek letter used elsewhere in FPF to avoid symbol conflicts.)*
For ordered Scales, the template states the comparison direction (↑ better / ↓ better / target‑is‑best). Any scoring method **𝒢** that issues a **Score** is order‑compatible with that declared polarity semantics.

**N‑4 — Unit coherence.**
Within one template there is one *primary* **Unit** of expression (or an explicit level‑set for non‑numeric Scales). Conversions are conceptually allowed only where the Scale supports meaningful arithmetic (interval/ratio); nominal/ordinal Scales are not subject to numeric conversions.

**N‑5 — Comparability guard.**
Two Measures are comparable *iff* they share the same template (hence, the same Characteristic + Scale + Unit) **or** stand in an explicit comparability relation whose single semantic owner is cited (e.g., an F‑cluster Bridge, or a cited characterization mechanism’s declared equivalence). Otherwise, comparability is not presumed.

**N‑6 — Evidence as conceptual anchoring.**
If a template requires it, each Measure includes an **EvidenceStub** that conceptually links the Value to its grounds; absence where required makes the Measure inadmissible for use. *(This is a conceptual obligation; no process mechanics are implied.)*

**N‑7 — Arity clarity.**
If the Characteristic is relational (applies to a pair/tuple), the subject of measurement is the relation itself; the reading must not be re‑described as a unary property of either participant.

**N‑8 — Open‑ended evolution; graph, not lifecycle.**
When MM‑CHR is used in change reasoning, movement happens in a **CharacteristicSpace** and along a **Role‑State Graph (RSG)**. There is no lifecycle terminal; revisions may re‑enter earlier framing nodes as per A.17. *(Conceptual control structure only.)*


#### C.16:10.2 - Anti‑Patterns (A‑rules) — with cures

**A‑1 — Scale drift under the same template.**
*Smell:* the Scale meaning (bounds, categories) shifts while the template ID remains.
*Cure:* version the template; declare the relation in the Unification suite.

**A‑2 — Arithmetic on ordinal.**
*Smell:* averaging “stars” or ranking labels as if they were intervals.
*Cure:* either keep order‑respecting operations only, or introduce a **ScoringMethod** that defines a proper Score range.

**A‑3 — Unit soup.**
*Smell:* mixing milliseconds and seconds for the same template, or “%” and “points” for one Scale.
*Cure:* one primary Unit per template; conversions (when meaningful) are declared conceptually, not ad‑hoc.

**A‑4 — Alias leakage.**
*Smell:* “axis/dimension/point/ladder” in normative identifiers or headings.
*Cure:* use only canonical tokens in normative prose; narrative labels are allowed *solely* in Plain register with first‑mention mapping (A.17).

**A‑5 — Multi‑Characteristic stuffing.**
*Smell:* one template tries to carry a vector of Values for several Characteristics.
*Cure:* separate templates (one Characteristic each) and compose coordinates explicitly when needed.

**A‑6 — Evidence afterthought.**
*Smell:* Measures required to have grounds are introduced without an intelligible EvidenceStub.
*Cure:* treat the EvidenceStub as part of the measurement claim itself, not an accessory.

**A‑7 — Template mutation after Measures exist.**
*Smell:* retro‑editing Characteristic/Scale/Unit of an active template.
*Cure:* immutability of that triad post‑use; publish a successor template if the concept changes.

**A‑8 — Score‑of‑everything.**
*Smell:* collapsing heterogeneous Values into a single “points” Score without declared ScoringMethod and SCP.
*Cure:* retain the Value on its Scale; add an explicit scoring method (by reference to its owner) and an explicit legality profile (owned elsewhere) only when there is a justified need for a Score.

### C.16:11 - Cross‑Domain Vignettes *(Informative, transdisciplinary)*

> *Each vignette shows an CSLC‑conformant template → measure, without duplicating the A.17/A.18 glossaries.*

**V‑A (Architecture — relational property).**
Characteristic: **Coupling** (relational) between modules; Scale: ordinal {Low, Med, High}; Unit: level‑labels; Polarity: ↓ better.
Reading: subsystem pair ⟨M₁, M₂⟩ gets **Med**; **ScoringMethod** (optional) maps levels monotonically to a bounded Score for comparative dashboards.

**V‑B (Physics — interval/ratio).**
Characteristic: **ResponseTime**; Scale: ratio with non‑negative reals; Unit: seconds; Polarity: ↓ better.
Reading: subject S has **0.237 s**; direct comparability holds with readings on the **same template**; cross‑template comparability requires an explicitly cited equivalence/Bridge/transformation owner.

**V‑C (Performing arts — ordinal).**
Characteristic: **EdgeControlQuality**; Scale: ordinal levels 1…5; Unit: level‑labels; Polarity: ↑ better.
Reading: performance P gets **4**; any aggregation remains order‑respecting. If a numeric dashboard score is needed, cite a scoring method **𝒢** that maps levels monotonically to a bounded Score.

**V‑D (AI ethics — ratio).**
Characteristic: **ParityGap** (difference of positive rates); Scale: interval with symmetric bounds; Unit: percentage points; Polarity: ↓ better (0 is target).
Reading: model M on cohort C shows **3.2 pp**; evidence points conceptually to the derivation rationale (inputs, reference cohorts).

### C.16:12 - Relations & Placement *(Informative)*

**Kernel.** MM‑CHR *imports* the canonical Characteristic vocabulary and the CSLC discipline fixed by A.17 and A.18; it does not redefine them. CharacteristicSpace reasoning (for change) lives in the patterns that consume MM‑CHR readings.

**Using patterns.** KD‑CAL, Arch‑CAL and others *instantiate* templates and produce measures; MM‑CHR remains a neutral measurement substrate. Trade‑off analyses and architectural trajectories operate over coordinates that MM‑CHR makes available, not inside MM‑CHR.

**Unification (F‑cluster).** External standards (e.g., ISO 80000 quantity types; W3C SOSA/SSN observable properties; QUDT units/quantity kinds) are related via Concept‑Set rows and Bridges; MM‑CHR treats those alignments as context supplied by F‑patterns, not as local re‑definitions.
